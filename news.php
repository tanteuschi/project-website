                            We are happy to announce that <a href="https://know-center.at/" class="underline" target="_blank">Know-Center</a> has joined the <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/team#team/" class="underline" target="_blank">Open Knowledge Maps core team</a> as our very first organizational member. Know-Center will support Open Knowledge Maps with a considerable contribution allowing us to cover our operational costs and grow as an independent organization. This is the next step in what has been a longstanding partnership between the two organizations. Peter Kraker, founder and chairman of Open Knowledge Maps, laid the foundations for the organization whilst at Know-Center, and Know-Center has been a strong partner and advocate ever since.
                            <br>
                            <br>Stefanie Lindstaedt, CEO of Know-Center, says: 
                                <blockquote>"At Know-Center, knowledge transfer is a key part of our mission. Open Knowledge Maps is a revolutionary tool in this regard, a window into science. Through this window, researchers, practitioners and citizens can explore the wealth of scientific knowledge in a much better way than before. We are excited to be a part of this unique open science endeavor."</blockquote>

                                <blockquote>"We are thrilled to take our partnership with Know-Center to the next level. If recent market entrances are any indication, discovery will be one of the key areas of the digital research infrastructure. Having Know-Center on board goes a long way in making Open Knowledge Maps a sustainable building block of the open science ecosystem."</blockquote>

                        <p class="newsitem-p">
                            2.5 million new research papers are published each year. That makes staying up-to-date a hard task - and it keeps you from doing actual research.
                            <br>
                            <br>But did you know that you can easily keep yourself updated using Open Knowledge Maps? Just select the option “Most recent” in the “Refine your search” section. Our award-winning software then creates a knowledge map based on the 100 most recent documents for your search term. That way you get an instant overview of the hottest topics in your field.
                            <br>

                                the Open Knowledge Maps team got together to improve 
                                the quality and usability of our knowledge maps. 
                                The sprint continued into last week and after much polishing, 
                                we have now released the new version on our site. Enhancements 
                                include improved naming and clustering as well as a higher 
                                visibility of open access papers.

                                We are honored to join Annotating All Knowledge, 
                                a coalition of more than 60 organisations aiming to 
                                create an open annotation layer over all scholarly knowledge. 
                                At Open Knowledge Maps, we support this goal, because we believe 
                                that open and collaborative processes will change the way we explore 
                                and discover research. As a first measure, we have enabled open annotation 
                                of all PDFs within our interface by integrating Hypothes.is into our 
                                "Preview PDF" window.

                                We are happy to announce that Open Knowledge Maps is now connected to one of the largest academic search engines in the world: BASE.<br><br>

                                For the first time you are able to visualize a research topic in any discipline. In addition, you can now search within different types of resources, including datasets and software. We would like to thank the <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/about_team.php?menu=2" target="_blank">BASE team</a> for their outstanding support in making this happen!<br><br>

                                We have also spent a lot of time improving the naming of the sub-areas to make the concepts in a field more visible - which means that this update improves our existing PubMed integration too.<br><br>

                                As always, we welcome any feedback you may have!

                                Great things have happened following our launch of the DOAJ and PubMed 
                                integrations. We saw a broad coverage on the web, including an appearance on the Reddit front 
                                page in early November and an article in c't magazine. More than 44,000 people visited 
                                Open Knowledge Maps in November, and almost 25,000 maps have been created to date.<br><br>
                                We have also introduced Open Knowledge Maps at numerous events including MozFest, OpenCon & OpenCon Berlin, and NetzPat Vienna to name just a few. In total, over 230 people attended our workshops and sessions. The positive feedback was overwhelming and we want to thank our emerging community for their great support. Loads of you have posted great comments, written articles and spread Open Knowledge Maps in your respective communities, posted issues and ideas on Github, or become part of the team and advisory board. A BIG THANK YOU! We are happy to see everyone getting involved and we are also thinking about new ways to make it even easier for you to be part of the Open Knowledge Maps community in the future. Together we can revolutionize discovery!

                                This means that you are now able to search 
                                within more than 28 million articles. In addition, we have completely overhauled our 
                                design and improved the user experience considerably - including the integration of 
                                the open annotation software Hypothes.is in our PDF preview. Try it out and let us
